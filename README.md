# Contents of 'micrometeo' GitHub space

The 'micrometeo' GitHub space has been created to host code relevant to the processing, reading, generation of data relevant to micro-meteorology.

All the code hosted within 'micrometeo' GitHub space are open-source. I, as the administrator, and also-working in academia, prefer the MIT open-source license, but the final choice is still to be made.

# Contents of this repository

This repository contains basic documents to ease development, for example license agreement texts, and useful modules, guidelines, directories of this space's repositories, and other life-easing resources.

This repository does not contain actual code.
